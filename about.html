                <p>Hi, my name is Obaregwu Munachi D. I am a 13 year old developer. I am currently schooling at the University of Nigeria, Secondary School, Nsukka. I started coding at the age of 8, and since then I've been progressing, I started with basic HTML, then CSS, until I decided to learn a main programming language, so after a few decisions, I learnt Python, which I continued till around last year, when I decided that I needed to learn another language, so I started learning JavaScript, this is one of my projects that I started from scratch, using just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, all on my own.
